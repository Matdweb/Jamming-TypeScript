# Jamming
This project allows authenticated users 👥 to create and customize 🎨 playlists 🎼 and send them to their Spotify account using API technologies.
The app helps users search 🔎 their favorites songs 🎧 and group them into a new playlist, always having the chance to modify it the way they want 😎. <br />
Take a look to the **design solution** in Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ce0bwas2kwugzVs2vS6Hri/Jamming?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=9YGx22OR99GbAqbZ-1).

You can find our original project, in wich we use `JavaScript`, [here](https://github.com/Matdweb/Jamming)

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font

### Experimental code
Before the development process began, three GitHub repositories were set up to contain experimental code for testing the functionalities of this app. Exploring these repositories can be highly beneficial if you wish to gain a deeper understanding of the API requests, Next.js best practices, Next.js endpoints, and other elements used in this application: 
- [Spotify Playlist Retriever v12](https://github.com/Matdweb/Spotiy-Playlist-Retriever-v12)
- [Spotify Playlist Retriever](https://github.com/Matdweb/Spotiy-Playlist-Retriever)
- [Album Searcher](https://github.com/Matdweb/AlbumSearcher-experimental)
