# Jamming
This project allows authenticated users üë• to create and customize üé® playlists üéº and send them to their Spotify account using API technologies.
The app helps users search üîé their favorites songs üéß and group them into a new playlist, always having the chance to modify it the way they want üòé. <br />
Take a look to the **design solution** in Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ce0bwas2kwugzVs2vS6Hri/Jamming?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=9YGx22OR99GbAqbZ-1).

You can find our original project, in wich we use `JavaScript`, [here](https://github.com/Matdweb/Jamming)

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font
